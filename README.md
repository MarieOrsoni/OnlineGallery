# ByRP – Portfolio Website for an Abstract Artist

This is a work-in-progress portfolio website I'm building for an abstract artist, RP.

## 🎨 Purpose

The goal of this project is to create a minimal, elegant online presence for RP that showcases their artwork and offers print options (e.g. aluminium, posters, table mats) in a clean and engaging layout.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React + Vite** – Frontend framework
- **Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI** – Utility-first CSS with prebuilt UI components for rapid styling
- **React Router** – Navigation between artwork pages
- **Optional**: Carousel for image display, animations with Framer Motion
🧪 Note:
I'm new to Tailwind CSS, so I'm combining it with traditional CSS for now. This project is part of my learning journey, and I’m using it to explore Tailwind’s potential.

## 🚧 Current Status

I'm currently working on:
- Gallery layout with responsive image cards
- Product detail pages for each artwork/format
- Navigation and landing page design

## 📌 Upcoming Features

- Mobile responsiveness
- Animations for transitions and interactivity
- A "Shop" experience tailored for visual artworks

## ✏️ Notes

This project reflects both my design sensibility and frontend development skills. I’m updating it regularly — feel free to check back soon for more progress!
