# Portfolio Website for an Abstract Artist

This is a work-in-progress portfolio website I'm building for an abstract artist, RP.
It includes both a frontend (React + Tailwind) and a backend (Swagger + MongoDB) built from scratch.
The project is an opportunity to improve my skills in React, MongoDB, API design (OpenAPI/Swagger), and experiment with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI.

## 🎨 Purpose

The goal of this project is to create a minimal, elegant online presence for RP that showcases their artwork and offers print options (e.g. aluminium, posters, table mats) in a clean and engaging layout.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
**Frontend**
- **React + Vite** – Frontend framework
- **Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI** – Utility-first CSS with prebuilt UI components for rapid styling
- **React Router** – Navigation between artwork pages
- **Optional**: Carousel for image display, animations with Framer Motion
🧪Learning Note:
I'm new to Tailwind CSS, so I'm combining it with traditional CSS for now. This project is part of my learning journey, and I’m using it to explore Tailwind’s potential.

**Backend**
- **Swagger/OpenAPI** (API spec)
- **MongoDB** (Database)
- **Postman** (for API testing)

## 🚧 Current Status
- [ ] Frontend project setup with Vite  
- [x] Started YAML API specification (based on Swagger PetStore)  
- [ ] MongoDB database setup  
- [ ] Postman API testing  
- [ ] Dynamic routing for artwork views  
- [ ] Styling with Tailwind and DaisyUI

## 📌 Upcoming Features

- Mobile responsiveness
- Animations for transitions and interactivity
- A "Shop" experience tailored for visual artworks

## ✏️ Notes

This project is also helping me learn more about API design, GitHub workflows, and connecting frontend and backend.

This project reflects both my design sensibility and frontend development skills. I’m updating it regularly — feel free to check back soon for more progress!
